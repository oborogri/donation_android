### This is a basic android application build following lab instructions###

* Version 01 *

Tasks:

• Create a new app called “Donation”
• The Donation application will consist of an activity
and a layout:
• An activity is an instance of Activity, a class in the
Android SDK.
• An activity is responsible for managing user
interaction with a screen of information.
• You write subclasses of Activity to implement the
functionality that your app requires.
• A simple application may need only one subclass; a
complex application can have many.
